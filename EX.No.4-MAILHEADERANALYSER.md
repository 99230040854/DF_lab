-   Gmail: Open the email, click the three dots (â‹®), and select Show
    original.

-   Select all the text in the header and copy it.

-   
  

**Step 2: Use a Mail Header Analyzer**

-   The easiest way to analyze the header is with an online tool.

-   Navigate to a site which analyze Email Header

-   Paste the entire header you copied into the analysis box.

-   Click the \"Analyze\" button to get a parsed, easy-to-read report.

> **Step 3: Analyze The Report**

-   This is the most critical step. In the analyzer\'s report, look for
    the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results.

**Review the Overall Delivery Summary**

-   First, look at the high-level summary to get an immediate sense of
    the email\'s status.

-   Check DMARC Compliance: The report shows the email is DMARC
    Compliant. This is the most important overall result.

-   Check SPF Status: Both SPF Authenticated and SPF Alignment passed.
    This means the sending server was authorized.

-   Check DKIM Status: DKIM Alignment passed, but DKIM Authenticated
    failed . This is a critical finding and indicates a problem with
    the email\'s digital signature.

**Investigate the SPF Record and Email Path**

-   Next, verify why the SPF check passed.

-   Examine the SPF Record: The SPF record for the domain is v=spf1
    include:mailgun.org \~all. This record explicitly authorizes servers
    from Mailgun to send emails on its behalf.

-   Trace the Relay Information: The delivery path shows the email was
    sent from m241-136.mailgun.net.

-   Conclusion: Since the email came from a Mailgun server, which is
    authorized in the SPF record, the SPF check passed.
